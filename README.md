# AIMS-Assignment
This repository was created to complete the tasks given by the AIMS Society, which specifically include "writing three Python scripts to perform Ordinal Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Imputation techniques using basic Python functions along with the NumPy and Pandas libraries, without using any predefined functions (e.g., get_dummies)."
